										<u>Network Classification</u> - Network is a system where computers are linked and therefore able to
										comunicate with each other and tranfer data. PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN is one way of classifying them
										in terms of how big the network spans.
									</li>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>PAN</b>: "Personal Area Network" A computer network that is used for short-range communication (less
											than a few meters) such as Bluetooth
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>LAN</b>: "Local Area Network" A computer network that consists of a collection of computers in a
											single building or building complex that are connected wirely though a "wifi" router
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>MAN</b>: "Metropolitan Area Network" A computer network that is a network of intermediate size, such
											as one spanning a local community
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>WAN</b>: "Wide Area Network" A computer network that is links machines over a greater distance—perhaps
											in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.

										<u>Network Models</u> - Bus and Star networks are another way of classify networks but instead
										differenciate them based on the topology of the network which refers to the patterm in which the
										machines are connected.
									</li>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Protocols</b>: Rules by which activities are conducted to ensure a network functions reliably, and
											make it possible for vendors to build products for network applications that are compatible with
											products from other vendors. Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable
											process in the development of networking technologies.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>CSMA/CD Ethernet</b>: "Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection" is a protocol used
											with Ethernet which dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus. Each
											machine monitors all the messages but keeps only those addressed to itself. CSMA/CD is not
											compatible with wireless star networks. EX</b>: To transmit a message, a machine waits until the bus
											is silent. If another machine also begins transmitting, both machines detect the clash and pause
											for a brief, independently random period of time before trying to transmit again.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>CSMA/CA WiFi</b>: "Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance" the policy of trying to
											avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them (many of which are standardized by IEEE).
											Collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them
											completely. When collisions do occur, messages must be retransmitted. The most common approach to
											collision avoidance is based on giving advantage to machines that have already been waiting for an
											opportunity to transmit. Similar to Ethernet's CSMA/CD. EX</b>: when a machine first needs to transmit
											a message and finds the communication channel silent, it does not start transmitting immediately.
											Instead, it waits for a short period of time and then starts transmitting only if the channel has
											remained silent throughout that period. This protocol, however, does not solve the hidden terminal
											problem. To solve this problem, some WiFi networks require that each machine send a short
											“request” message to the AP and wait until the AP acknowledges that request before transmitting an
											entire message.

										<u>Combined Networks</u> - Sometimes it is necessary to connect existing networks to form an
										extended communication system. This can be done by connecting the networks to form a larger version
										of the same “type” of network. For example connecting two bus networks to form a single long bus.
									</li>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>repeater</b>: Simplilest network connector that passes signals back and forth between the two original
											buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>bridge</b>: Similar but more complex than repeater. It looks at the destination address that
											accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is
											destined for a computer on the other side. Thus, two machines residing on the same side of a
											bridge can exchange messages without interfering with communication taking place on the other
											side. A bridge produces a more efficient system than that produced by a repeater.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>switch</b>: Is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses
											rather than just two. It produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch
											(like spokes on a wheel) and considers the destination addresses of all messages and forwards only
											those messages destined for other spokes. Moreover, each message that is forwarded is relayed only
											into the appropriate spoke, thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>router</b>: In contrast to those above, this is a special purpose computer that connects networks that
											have incompatible potocols/charateristics, acting as a manager so the networks can still
											communicate and forward messages. This forms an internet (not The Internet). Also fowards messages
											in their proper direction using an internt-wide address system called IP address.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>gateway</b>: The “point” at which one network is linked to an internet, and it serves as a passageway
											between the network and the outside world. Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus
											the term is used rather loosely. In many cases, a network's gateway is merely the router through
											which it communicates with the rest of the internet. In other cases, the term gateway may be used
											to refer to more than just a router. EX: in most residential WiFi networks that are connected to
											the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's AP and the router
											connected to the AP because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.

										<u>Client/Server Model</u> - A popular method for interprocess commmunication (which is
										communication between different computers within a network or even within the same machine when
										mutitasking in order to coordinate actions and preform their designated tasks) which defines the
										basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or
										a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.
									</li>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>P2P</b>: "peer-to-peer" this is a model which involves processes that provide service to and receive
											service from each other. Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is
											prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that
											execute on a temporary basis. For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant
											messaging, in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet, as well as
											situations in which people play competitive interactive games. The collection of peers
											participating in such a distribution is sometimes called a swarm.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>distribution system</b>: A software design that consists of software units that execute as processes
											on different computers. It is a system that connects independent computers so they can work
											closely together to provide computation or services compatible to a much larger machine. In
											simpilar terms, it makes multiple smaller computers able to do the work of one big supercomputer
											that might be more expensive.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>cloud computing</b>: a distribution system whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can
											be allocated for use by clients as needed. EX: Services such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud
											allow clients to rent virtual computers by the hour, without concern for where the computer
											hardware is actually located.

											<b>malware</b>: Malicioud software that might be transfered to, and executed on, the computer itself or

										</li>
										<li>
											<b>virus</b>: A software that "infects" a computer by inserting itself into programs that alreasy reside
											in the machine. Then, when the “host” program is executed, the virus is also executed. When
											executed, many viruses do little more than try to transfer themselves to other programs within the
											computer. Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the
											operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other
											programs
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>worm</b>: an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in
											computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers. As in the case of a virus, a worm
											can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism. A characteristic
											consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the
											performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>trojan horse</b>: a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a
											game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim. Once in the computer,
											however, the Trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.
											Sometimes these additional activities start immediately. In other instances, the Trojan horse
											might lie dormant until triggered by a specific event such as the occurrence of a preselected
											date. Trojan horses often arrive in the form of attachments to enticing email messages
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>spyware</b>: software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides
											and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack. Some companies use spyware as a
											means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit. In
											other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol
											sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>phishing</b>: a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it. It is often
											carried out via email, and in this form, it is little more than an old telephone con. The
											perpetrator sends email messages posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or
											perhaps a law enforcement agency. The email asks the potential victim for information that is
											supposedly needed for legitimate purposes. However, the information obtained is used by the
											perpetrator for hostile purposes.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>DoS attack</b>: "Denial of Service" the process of overloading a computer with messages. Denial of
											service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt
											the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.
											A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages in a short period
											of time in order to overwhelm the targeted server.

											<b>firewall</b>: A primary prevention technique that is used to filter traffic passing through a point in

										</li>
										<li>
											<b>spam filter</b>: A version of firewall designed for the specific purpose of blocking unwanted emails

										<li>
											<b>proxy server</b>: A software unit that has filtering connotations by acting as an intermediary between
											a cliatn and a server with the goal of sheilding the client from adverse actions of the

										</li>
										<li>
											<b>antivirus software</b>: A software that is a means of defense against invasions via network
											connections which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.
											antivirus software must be routinely maintained by downloading updates from the software's vendor.
											Even this, however, does not guarantee the safety of a computer. After all, a new virus must first
											infect some computers before it is discovered and a vaccine is produced. Thus, a wise computer
											user never opens email attachments from unfamiliar sources, does not download software without
											first confirming its reliability, does not respond to pop-up adds, and does not leave a computer
											connected to the Internet when such connection is not necessary.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>cryptography</b>: the study of sending and receiving messages securely in the presence of adversaries.
											Cryptographic tools such as encryption can be used to transform a message into a coded version
											such that even if the encrypted data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will
											remain confidential.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>public key encryption</b>: A topic in the field of cryptography which involves techniques by which the
											encryption and decryption algorithms are known, and one of the keys is known, but the encoded
											message remains secure. A public-key encryption system involves the use of two keys. One key,
											known as the public key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private key, is
											required to decrypt messages
